Sodapop, a minimal web application framework


1.  Introduction
    
    Sodapop is a minimal framework for PHP. It aims to provide common function-
    alities found in a web application, as every framework does. However, Sodapop
    features the most minimal functionalities, and forgets the others.
    Sodapop has the following features and nonfeatures.
    
    What's in:
    
    - HTTP request/response
    - RESTful URL routing
    
    What's out:
    
    - Object-relational mapping / database management
    - Template engine
    
    
2.  Word of warning
    
    Sodapop is an experimental framework. It was designed using the experience
    I learned while working on Underwear (https://github.com/eurekasfray/underwear).
    Sodapop is not intended for production.
    
    I have little knowledge of the best practices that are used in the design of web
    application frameworks. This project is intended to develop such knowledge,
    and is practise that shall lead to me learning about framework design. May this
    framework mature into being smart and well-designed.
